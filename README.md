- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @the-potatoeyo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating video games using open-source game engines. Mainly UPBGE and Turbowarp. I no longer use Unity because of their pricing updates, so I'm gonna switch to both UPBGE and Godot for 3D.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Blender Game Engine, UPBGE (basically Blender Game Engine but brought to work with new versions), Godot Engine (kinda like Unity), and TurboWarp (basically a better version of Scratch)

I ain't just a video game designer, I'm also a musician who creates instrumental music since October 2018 (first release in February 2019), Scratch programmer (since January 4, 2017 although I have used Scratch since October 2016), 3D animator and 3D modeler,
video game texture editor/maker, gamer, Rubik's Cube collector, CD collector, and YouTuber. (Phew, that's a lot of words!)

- I make music on LMMS 1.3 and FL Studio 21 (Fruity Edition)
- I make animations on Blender (Steam version), used to make 2D animations on Scratch and Krita but now I pretty much make mainly 3D animations on Blender
- I program games since 2016. Used to program games from 2017-2021 at my very best on Scratch until I eventually lost interest and moved on to making 3D games on Blender. Although I still make projects on Scratch, just not as usually and mainly music players and my own news posts on daily things. I would've wanted to become a Unity developer, but since their new changes have gotten the best of that, I deleted my Unity account and projects completely and walked back to UPBGE. I am a total noob at text coding, I only know how to tweak Python and HTML/CSS code especially on Tynker.
- I make videos on YouTube since I got my channel and some of my videos there are even older than my channel because I have been storing a few over 2022.
